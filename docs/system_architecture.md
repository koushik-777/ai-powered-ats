# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The AI Recruitment System is designed to automate and enhance the recruitment process through a multi-agent architecture. This system integrates various components that work collaboratively to match candidates with job descriptions, shortlist qualified applicants, and streamline the interview scheduling process.

## Components

### 1. Job Description Summarizer
- **Purpose**: Extracts and summarizes key elements from job descriptions.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `extract_key_elements`: Identifies required skills, experience, qualifications, and responsibilities.
  - `summarize`: Provides a concise summary of the job description.
- **Technologies**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis.

### 2. CV/Resume Parser and Analyzer
- **Purpose**: Extracts relevant information from CVs in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- **Key Functions**:
  - `parse_cv`: Reads and processes CV files.
  - `extract_information`: Extracts education, work experience, skills, certifications, and other qualifications.
- **Technologies**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) for standardizing extracted information.

### 3. Matching Algorithm
- **Purpose**: Compares CV data against job requirements to determine candidate suitability.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `compare`: Evaluates candidate qualifications against job descriptions.
  - `generate_match_percentage`: Calculates a match score based on essential and preferred qualifications.
- **Technologies**: Scoring algorithms that account for related skills and transferable experience.

### 4. Candidate Shortlisting System
- **Purpose**: Filters candidates based on match scores and generates ranked shortlists.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `filter_candidates`: Applies configurable thresholds for automatic shortlisting.
  - `generate_shortlist`: Produces a ranked list of candidates with justifications for selection.
- **Considerations**: Incorporates diversity and inclusion metrics.

### 5. Interview Scheduler
- **Purpose**: Automates communication with shortlisted candidates and schedules interviews.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `schedule_interview`: Manages the scheduling of interviews.
  - `send_invitation`: Sends personalized email invitations to candidates.
- **Technologies**: Integration with calendar systems for availability tracking.

## Data Management
- **Database**: SQLite is used for persistent storage and retrieval of candidate and job data.
- **Schema**: The database schema defines tables and relationships necessary for the recruitment process.

## User Interface
- **Components**: The user interface includes a dashboard, candidate list, and interview schedule management.
- **Technologies**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive design.

## API Integration
- **Routes**: The system exposes various API endpoints for job description summarization, CV parsing, candidate matching, shortlisting, and interview scheduling.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation is provided for developers.

## Performance and Monitoring
- **Logging**: A logging system is implemented to track system events and errors.
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics are collected to evaluate the efficiency of the recruitment process.

## Conclusion
The AI Recruitment System leverages advanced technologies to streamline the recruitment process, ensuring a more efficient and effective matching of candidates to job opportunities. The multi-agent architecture allows for modular development and scalability, accommodating future enhancements and integrations.
